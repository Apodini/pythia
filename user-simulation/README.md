# User Simulation

Using locustio for simulating different users on the sock-shop.

Following user groups will be simulated:

+ Users just browsing through catalogue (maybe setting different filters)
+ Users just browsing through catalogue and adding things to cart
+ Users browsing through catalogue, adding to cart (maybe randomly delete and add), registering, setting payment and address and ordering
+ Users logging in and looking at account/orders
+ Users logging in, browsing catalogue, adding things to cart and ordering it
